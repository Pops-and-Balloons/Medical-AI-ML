# Medical AI/ML Projects by Hyung-Jun Park

Hello, I'm Hyung-Jun Park. This is a space where I document and share projects from my studies in the AI/ML field.

This repository contains the entire process of machine learning projects, including data analysis, modeling, and performance evaluation, using public medical datasets. Each project folder includes the code for the analysis process, along with an individual README file that summarizes the project's goals and results.

More detailed explanations of the analysis process and theory are posted on my tech blog, **[Fireworks and Balloons](https://stmphj12.tistory.com/)**.
